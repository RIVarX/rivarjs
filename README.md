# rivarjs
Reactive Instance Variable for JavaScript based on rxjs

`rivarjs` is a decentralized state management library that automates changes. It harmonizes concepts from the object-oriented programming (OOP) and functional reactive programming (FRP) paradigms. At its core, `rivarjs` introduces a datatype called `RIVar`, which stands for *Reactive Instance Variable*.<br><br> 

The term *Reactive* signifies that *assignments* initiate dependencies, ensuring continuous updates in response to changes. The term *Instance* implies the facilitation of *information hiding*, as assignments can be performed *externally*. Subclasses assign variables of their parents, while composites assign variables of the objects they contain.
